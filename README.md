# qtff-exif-reader

Originally created to extract the display orientation of Quicktime videos typically taken on iPhones and iPads in a browser, this has now become and EXIF data reader for Quicktime(qtff) and mp4 video formats.

Currently able to extract and display data for the Track & Sample Atoms and most of their sub atoms but more work is being done to get better coverage of the whole file.

Used in [Dongci - Video to .gif converter](https://dongci.kawo.com) & [Subtitle Studio - Subtitle editor](https://subtitle.studio) for the forementioned purpose.
